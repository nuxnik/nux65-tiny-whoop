# Nux65 Tiny whoop

Let's build a lightweight tiny whoop with a top loading battery, carbon fiber frame and high KV motors. Before This project is a build guide for a 65 mm tiny whoop that was highly inspired by the [Fractal65](https://store.fractalengineering.net/product/fractal-65-bnf) tiny whoop by [Fractal Engineering](https://fractalengineering.net). This project was built in the “fractal whoop style”. In other words, this design is light-weight and stresses minimalism and robustness. However, calling it a “fractal style” whoop is not an accurate description. Therefore, for reasons of clarity, I will refer to this build as the Nux65. This project is a variant of a theme. I am not trying to copy Fractal Engineering designs, however, my design choices were highly inspired by them. It is my attempt at making something of my own, while at the same time paying homage to Fractal Engineering's creative design choices.

# 3D Printed Parts

The battery is mounted on top of the drone and sandwiched between the whoop rings. This build will require a three tiny 3D printed parts.
